It's broadly either for Business users, or for Technical users - not only that, but it ranges from the 10,000ft viewpoint, all the way down to the lowest-level detail. We understand not everyone has the same needs.\n\n## In what formats are courses offered?\n\n### Presentation Format\n\nTraining courses are offered in presentation format - meaning that a course is typically created as a presentation that can be either consumed independently by the student (this is usually referred to as Self-Paced Learning), or an instructor may deliver it (remotely, or in person).\n\n### Personal Lab Environments\n\nSince we perceive there to be significant value in 'learning by doing', there are practical exercises that accompany every topic of every course, performed by the student in their own, personal copy of a lab environment - this is a specially-configured virtual machine, which runs the Cúram software, set up in a certain way to support the lab exercises and learning experience of the student.\n\n## What courses and learning paths are available?\n\nWe understand that different students have different needs, and so our training is organised into specific tracks, mostly aligned with the different core role types (i.e. Business User, or Technical User).
