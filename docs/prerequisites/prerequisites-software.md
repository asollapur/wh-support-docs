## Web browsers

with the is developed for public-facing applications. Every effort was made to ensure that the application pages use standard web technologies and formats to be compatible with all browsers that are listed. However, the browsers that are listed in the following table are the only browsers that are officially supported.

**Note:** The browser **Back** and **Forward** buttons, and browser refresh, are now supported on IEG pages in the . Information that is entered in IEG forms is now retained when the citizen clicks **Next** or goes back or forward through a form.

Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari release new versions more frequently than Internet Explorer, and they install updates automatically by default. releases are tested on the latest browser versions that are available at the start of the IBM development cycle.

**Note:** Only stable Chrome releases are tested.

If no issues result from the tests, IBM certifies the browser version.

For each new product release, the prerequisites list the version that is certified. If IBM cannot certify that version for any reason, you might need to revert to a previous version that is fully certified. While IBM supports customers who use newer versions of these browsers than the last certified version, customers must understand that the versions are not fully tested.
