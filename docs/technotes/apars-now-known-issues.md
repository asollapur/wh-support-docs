# APARs are being replaced with known issues

## Abstract

As part of the IBMÂ® Support Transformation initiative, starting 25 April 2022, APARs are being replaced with known issues.

### What are known issues?

A known issue is the means by which a problem in an IBM program is documented, tracked, and corrected.

A known issue is raised by the IBM support team when a new problem (support case) is reported for which a program or documentation change is required. After the known issue has been addressed in the product through a release, for example, a continuous delivery (CD) release, long term support (LTS) release,  or iFix, it is then closed.

### How do you know if a known issue has been created for a case?

Log on to the support portal, navigate to Cases and open your case.  On the case page, if a known issue has been created, you will see it displayed at the side, as shown in the following diagram:
