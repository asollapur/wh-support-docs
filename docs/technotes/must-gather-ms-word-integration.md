* Does the issue happen on one specific user computer, a group of computers or all computers?
* If not all computers, what is common to the affected computer/group that differs from the other computer where there is no issue?
* Conversely - Is the issue reproducible on other computer with the same configuration?
* Provide computer-specific details on which the issue occurs:
  
  * Version of the operating system on the affected user computer.
  * Version of all JREs installed on the affected user computer.
  * The privilege level of the Windows operating system user who performed the JRE installation.
  * Web browser name and exact version that was used in the test scenario. For example, Internet Exporer 10.0.9200.16750.
  * Exact version of Microsoft Word installed on the affected user computers. For example,  MS Word 2003 (11.8409.8405) SP3.
  * The privilege level of the Windows operating system user who performs the test scenario.

 Complete the following steps to enable logging:

* Editing session trace log.
  
  * You can create a trace log file on a user computer by setting the Control Panel -> Java -> Advanced -> Debugging -> Enable logging option.
  * If you enable logging in this way, the trace messages are output (in Microsoft Windows 7) to `C:\Users\<user_home>\AppData\LocalLow\Sun\Java\Deployment`.
