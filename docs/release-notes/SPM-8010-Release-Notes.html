<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="274388"></a>WorkItem:274388 - Modal dialog buttons transition improvements<br/><p><b>Issue Description:</b><br/>In version 8.0.0, modal dialogs and modal-based wizards have the following transition issues.<br/><br/>While modal-based wizards are in transition, for example, loading the next page, the modal footer buttons style remains the same as the general button styling concerning color and layout. This implies that the user can interact with the modal footer buttons while the rest of the content in the modal is blurred by the progress spinner background or the loading mask. If a user clicks on any of the footer buttons during this transition time, they no longer display. <br/><br/>The button transition issue can also be seen in a single modal scenario. The buttons disappear after a click but the screen itself is still displayed; the buttons become opaque and stay until the dialog closes.<br/><br/>There is no difference in principle between the single modal and the wizard, the same is happening in both transitions. The only difference is that in the case of wizards, the modal stays with the new content, and in the case of the single modal, the action usually returns to the content pane which is optionally reloaded. <br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/><br/><b>Scenario 1:</b><br/><ol><li>Login as a caseworker.<li>Click Person under Registration in the shortcuts panel.<li>Click the Next button in the Register Person wizard.<li>Issue: When the wizard is transitioning, all the modal buttons disappear and the new buttons are just drawn after the next screen with the full details loads. </ol><b>Scenario 2:</b><br/><ol><li>Login as a caseworker.<li>Create a new Task to open the New Task modal.<li>Click the Save and New button.<li>Issue: When the modal is transitioning, all the modal buttons disappear and the new buttons are just drawn after the next screen with the full details loads. </ol><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The modal dialog buttons transition has been improved by delaying their removal from the modal footer until the new button set is to be drawn. The modal footer style has been updated to display a different style when the transition is ongoing. The opacity (transparency) has been increased while the dialog is in transition, for example, when new content is loading. When the dialog is closed or has new content loaded, this styling is removed. The buttons are now not disappearing as previously and are displayed on the modal until either the dialog closes or the new content loads into the same dialog. <br/><br/>The buttons are now put in the transitional state which is marked by making them partly opaque and not active. The transition state lasts until the dialog is discarded (single modal scenario), or the new content with different buttons is loaded (modal-based wizard scenario). <br/><br/></p></p>

On insertion of each new product level verification, the status of the new verification needs to be determined. However, the status of all verifications on the product delivery case and the parent-integrated case that are linked to the same evidence type is evaluated during each new insertion.

For static evidence, such as that captured in an Income Support case, the label that was used for the tab that is used to view corrections information was labeled ‘History’, however, for dynamic evidence, such as that displayed within an Insurance Affordability case, the tab name was displayed as ‘Corrections’. Additionally, when evidence was viewed at the person level, the label for the tab that is used to view the overall change history was labeled ‘Corrections’. <br/><br/>2) When evidence is expanded, a change history of the evidence, including the user who modified the evidence, is displayed. Previously, when the evidence was created by one user and then corrected by other users, the last user to correct the evidence was being displayed for all correction records making it difficult to view a history of all users who are involved in updating the evidence.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce (Issue 1: Tab names):</b><br/><br/><b>(Issue 1a: Person evidence tab names):</b><br/><ol><li>Login as a caseworker.<li>Register a new Person.<li>Click the Evidence tab and expand any of the evidence types.<li>Issue: The set of tab names display as: Details, Corrections, Issues, Verifications.

Before these enhancements, it was possible under some scenarios to share evidence from multiple source Participant Data Cases (PDCs) in a single transaction to one target case, such as an integrated case. Now when advanced evidence sharing is enabled, this type of sharing can no longer occur. This can cause issues for custom processing that was implemented before the release of the enhancements to the Evidence Broker.<br/><br/><b>User Interface Impact:</b> No<br/><br/><b>Steps to Reproduce:</b><br/>There are no steps to reproduce this issue. This can be reproduced only with custom code that creates or modifies evidence records on multiple person cases within the same transaction. <br/><br/><b>Resolution:</b><br/>The Evidence Broker functionality has been updated to support the ability to share evidence from multiple source PDCs in a single transaction to one target case. A new application property 'curam.aes.advancedEvidenceSharingPDCException' has been added. Any evidence types specified in this property, which also exist on PDCs, will be eligible for sharing from multiple source cases in the same transaction.

<a name="deprecation"></a><h2>Notes on Deprecation</h2><a name="Deprecation"></a><a name=""></a>
This section describes artifacts that are deprecated in this release and the functionality that supersedes them.<p/>

Enhancements or defect fixes might require the contract of a development artifact to be changed. In this context, the contract of an artifact is its API or signature, for example, name, parameters, return values, and its documented statement of functionality, for example, Javadoc.<p/>

In these cases, deprecation is used to reduce the impact of the change on custom applications. The original artifact is preserved and marked as 'deprecated' to indicate that it has been superseded by other functionality (often a new artifact). Infrastructure is provided to assist you in identifying custom dependencies on these deprecated artifacts. Deprecation can affect customizations in a number of different ways and has some implications for customer support. For more information about deprecation, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the C&#250;ram Server Developer's Guide. This chapter describes what deprecation is, how it can affect custom code, what it means for support and the build infrastructure that helps pinpoint custom artifact dependencies on deprecated artifacts.<p/>

You can find out whether your code is affected by any of the following deprecations (and precisely where) by running the deprecationreport build target. If that build produces deprecation warnings, then you are affected by one or more of the deprecated artifacts that are itemized. For more information about using the build target and analyzing its output, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the C&#250;ram Server Developer's Guide.

One such instance where this issue manifests is in Child Welfare. When a user creates a Child Welfare intake on an iPad, they are not able to navigate to the Participants tab. <br/><br/><br/></p></p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;color: rgb(0,128,128);"><a name="274649"></a>WorkItem:274649 - System message visibility field code-table blank value does not default to blank on edit of the record.<br/><p>A new drop-down field called 'Visibility' has been added to the table 'SystemMessage' in 8.0.1. The value determines the user group that the message is visible to, for example, 'Logged-in users', 'Public users' or 'Public and logged-in users'. For existing records on the 'SystemMessage' table, the value of the new field 'Visibility' is set to 'null'. The 'Visibility' field 'null' value has the same meaning as the default value of 'Logged-in user'. When a 'System Message' record with a 'Visibility' field value of 'null' is edited, the 'Visibility' field drop-down incorrectly defaults to 'Logged-in user' instead of a blank value. <br/><br/>To address this issue, an additional property 'USE_DEFAULT="false"' needs to be added to the 'Visibility' 'FIELD element of the page SystemMessage_modifySystemMessage.vim. This will be updated in a subsequent release.<br/><br/></p></p>

For example, when an 'Anonymous' type is selected, only the 'Cancel' and 'Finish' buttons should display. Currently, all three buttons (Cancel, Next, and Finish) are displayed regardless of the Reporter type selected.<br/><br/></p></p>
