# Merative software download process

In the short term, while we create the new Merative support experience, you can download software such as iFixes, Testfixes, and maintenance releases from a shared Microsoft SharePoint folder. You must request access for each person in your organization who needs to download Merative software.

## Requesting access to the Merative software downloads folder

1.	Open a support case on the Merative support website with the subject line ‘Access request for Merative downloads’.
2.	In the request, provide email addresses for all people who need to download Merative software. These addresses must be company email addresses with a domain that corresponds to your organization. Do not use personal email addresses.
3.	Merative support reviews your request and notifies you when access is granted.
