### Question

Why are two versions of the Cúram Upgrade Helper available for download on the [Merative Support Community](https://ibmwatsonhealth.force.com/mysupport/s/?language=en_US)?

### Answer

Because of changes in the Social Program Management Java™ Development Environment (JDE), the “IBMCuramUpgradeHelper_Latest” Cúram Upgrade Helper on the Merative Support Community is no longer compatible with upgrades to Social Program Management 8.0.1.0 and earlier versions. Therefore, a second version of the Cúram Upgrade Helper is available on the Merative Support Community that you can use for upgrades to Social Program Management 8.0.1.0 and earlier.

* Use the IBMCuramUpgradeHelper_Latest Cúram Upgrade Helper only to upgrade to **Social Program Management 8.0.1.1 and later versions**.
* Use the IBMCuramUpgradeHelper_8010_Releases_And_Earlier Cúram Upgrade Helper only to upgrade to **Social Program Management 8.0.1.0 and earlier versions**.
