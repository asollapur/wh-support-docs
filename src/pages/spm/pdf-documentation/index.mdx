From July 1 2022, Cúram Social Program Management documentation will no longer be updated in IBM Documentation, and will remain at version 8.0.2. For a transitional period, before the release of the new documentation website, any important updates or addendums will be added here.

You can still rely on the online information for 8.0.2 until the next release. However, the Universal Access Responsive Web Application and Social Program Management Design System assets are released more often than Social Program Management. The last update for the online asset documentation was for version 5.2.0, and more recent versions will be provided here in PDF format only.
