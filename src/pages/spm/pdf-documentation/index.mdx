From July 1 2022, Cúram Social Program Management documentation is no longer updated in IBM Documentation. However, you can still rely on the online information until the next SPM release.

* [Cúram Social Program Management 8.0.2 online documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.2)

Any urgent updates or addendums will be added here.

The Universal Access Responsive Web Application and Social Program Management Design System are released more frequently than Cúram Social Program Management, and have their own version numbering scheme. You can find the most recent updates here in PDF format until the new documentation website is available.
