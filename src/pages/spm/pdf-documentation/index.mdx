For a transitional period, before the release of the new Merative Social Program Management documentation website, any important updates or addendums to the Merative Social Program Management documentation will be added here.  

You can still rely on the online IBM 8.0.2 documentation, which was last updated in June 2022. However, the Universal Access Responsive Web Application and Social Program Management Design System assets are released more often than Social Program Management:

* Documentation for asset versions that were released from 1 July 2022 is provided in this page, only in PDF format.
* The online IBM 8.0.2 documentation includes asset documentation up to version 5.2.0.

 **Note:** If the following links don't work in Google Chrome, try opening them in a private/incognito window, or another browser, such as Mozilla Firefox.
