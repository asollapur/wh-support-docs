# Curam Education
## Why take training?
If you've seen anything of the Curam platform, chances are you appreciate that it is a big product, with not just vast functionality to support complex business use cases, but also technically sophisticated and very configurable.
## Who is Curam Education for?
Our training typically falls into one of 2 categories. It's broadly either for Business users, or for Technical users - not only that, but it ranges from the 10,000ft viewpoint, all the way down to the lowest-level detail. We understand not everyone has the same needs.
## How do I decide what courses to take?
We offer learning plans, to guide you along a defined path, ensuring that you're learning what is important for you, and learning things in the right order.
## What formats are offered?
Training courses are offered in presentation format - meaning that a course is typically created as a presentation that can be either consumed independently by the student (this is usually referred to as Self-Paced Learning), or an instructor may deliver it (remotely, or in person).
Since we perceive there to be significant value in 'learning by doing', there are practical exercises that accompany every topic of every course, performed by the student in their own, personal copy of a lab environment - this is a specially-configured virtual machine, which runs the Curam software setup in a certain way to support the lab exercises and learning experience of the student.
