## Why take training?
If you've seen anything of the Curam platform, chances are you appreciate that it is a big product, with not just vast functionality to support complex business use cases, but also technically sophisticated and very configurable.
## Who is Curam Education for?
Our training typically falls into one of 2 categories. It's broadly either for Business users, or for Technical users - not only that, but it ranges from the 10,000ft viewpoint, all the way down to the lowest-level detail. We understand not everyone has the same needs.
## In what formats are courses offered?
Training courses are offered in presentation format - meaning that a course is typically created as a presentation that can be either consumed independently by the student (this is usually referred to as Self-Paced Learning), or an instructor may deliver it (remotely, or in person).
Since we perceive there to be significant value in 'learning by doing', there are practical exercises that accompany every topic of every course, performed by the student in their own, personal copy of a lab environment - this is a specially-configured virtual machine, which runs the Curam software, set up in a certain way to support the lab exercises and learning experience of the student.
## What courses and learning paths are available?
We understand that different students have different needs, and so our training is organised into specific tracks, mostly aligned with the different core role types (i.e. Business User, or Technical User). Please open the following PDF to get the full picture:

## Certification
The Education team is currently in the process of migrating the V7 certification tests to a new provider. The plan is to complete the migration by end of Q2 2023.
We will develop V8 certification tests and plan to release them during the second half of 2023. In the meantime, the V7 training courses and certification tests are still valuable and relevant for people who will work on V8 projects. No one need delay their SPM certification process by waiting for the V8 tests.
