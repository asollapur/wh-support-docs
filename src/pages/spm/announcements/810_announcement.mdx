## Merative Social Program Management 8.1

Merative™ Social Program Management is a leading solution for supporting the end-to-end social program and care coordination service delivery process. Merative Social Program Management 8.1 includes key enhancements to help citizens, caseworkers, and developers.

### Caseworker productivity

* Caseworker productivity improvements aim to improve the efficiency of completing a task as well as improve the user experience. In 8.1, we have improved the use of dropdowns in modals across all tasks throughout Curam. The filtering mechanism in dropdowns has been enhanced to provide a combination of both 'starts with' and 'contains', making it easier and more intuitive for caseworkers to find and select the required value from the dropdown list.

* In 8.1, we continue to extend multilingual support, which provides efficiency gains for multilingual caseworkers. Displaying the user interface in the citizen's language removes the cognitive load imposed on multilingual caseworkers so they do not need to translate. It also promotes a good flow of communication with the language displayed in the user interface matching the language caseworkers use verbally with the citizen. In this release multilingual support is now available for work queues, quick link names, organization structure and unit names, as well as position, job, and location names. Anywhere these are presented to a caseworker, they can be displayed in an alternative language once the caseworker selects to change the display of the UI to that alternative language.

### Developer productivity

* Developers are supported in implementing authentication requirements in custom solutions through technical documentation that provides step-by-step guide on configuration and examples where appropriate. In this release we have extended the documentation available to developer for the implementation of authentication requirements. New documentation provides a step-by-step guide to configure Microsoft Azure as an IdP for SAML SSO. Also new documentation provides guidance on to configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) based single sign-on using Microsoft Azure as the OIDC provider.  

* New hookpoints have been added to key financial business processes. These facilitate the inclusion of custom requirements into these business processes in a compliant manner. Compliant implementation promote easier future upgrades.

* The Web Client Reference Manual has been extended to provide an example on how to refresh a context panel. On page refresh, caseworkers need all aspects of a page to be updated with the latest information, including the context panel. The new example added to the documentation clarifies how refresh of a context panel can be achieved in custom solutions.

### Accessibility – TBD

SPM is committed to meeting major accessibility standards (e.g WCAG) and legislations around web accessibility. In 8.1 we improved how information is presented and how users interact with some user interface elements delivering infrastructural and ad-hoc changes. A few examples are around improving programmatically defined labels and headings, interactions with navigation bars, and focus visible and following a meaning sequence. Developer productivity
