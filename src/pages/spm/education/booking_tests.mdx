This page describes how you can book to take a Cúram Certification Test.

## What Test System is used ##

All tests are delivered online via the Prometric ProProctor system. Please note that all tests are delivered ONLINE and there is no longer an option to take a Cúram Certification test in a physical Test Center.

## Booking your Test ##

### Step 1 - Eligibility Code ###

You first need an Eligibility code, which you obtain by contacting the Certification Program Manager, Paul Grennan: [paul.grennan@merative.com](mailto:paul.grennan@merative.com)

When you take the Certification test, you will be required to show a valid form of photographic ID, that includes your First and Last names. Include the following info in your request to the Certification Program Manager:

+ First name(s) - as indicated on ID – clearly indicated as first name(s)
+ Full last name(s) - as indicated on ID – clearly indicated as last name(s).
+ First and last names much match exactly the full first and full last name(s) on the photo ID that will be used to prove identity during the test session. E.g. if your name on your ID is “Frank J. Smith” your first name should be “Frank J.” and last name is “Smith” or “John Jacob Jingleheimer Schmidt” would be “John Jacob” as first and then “Jingleheimer Schmidt” as last name.
+ Email that you will use for the booking – One eligibility code will only work with one email for registration

Your request should be processed within two business days.

### Step 2 - Using the Eligibility Code to book your Test ###

You can register for a test on the Merative Cúram Certification Program page:
