### Test Preparation

All test questions come from content in the main training manual for 9D72G – Fundamentals of the IBM Cúram SPM Platform for Business Analysts 7.X.

In addition to the course manual, it is strongly recommended that you study the Review the Concepts questions in the 9D72G exercise workbook.

Here is some advice that might help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ It is recommended that certification candidates take the **Practice Test (P002)** before they attempt the Certification Test (C002). In the test codes, C stands for Certification and P stands for Practice.
+ The Practice Test contains the same number of questions as the Certification Test and is designed to have the same level of difficulty. Your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. It is suggested to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.  
+ Try to take the test approximately 2-5 weeks after completing this training course. You need to allow yourself time to study. However, if you wait too long after the course, you’ll start to lose some of what you learned. Keep in mind that anything in the course manual is fair game for a test question but try to focus on the main ideas and details of each lesson.
+ The Review the Concepts questions within the training course are a good way to test yourself. Do NOT take the test until you can answer all of the in-course questions from memory.
+ For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tells you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…”and be followed by the prompt “Select 3.” Use these indicators to help you select or eliminate some of the options.
+ After you complete the test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the three tested sections. If you don’t pass the test, this report can help identify the areas that need more attention before you try again.
