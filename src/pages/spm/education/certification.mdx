The Cúram Certification Program helps you to become a valuable Cúram resource to your customers, colleagues, and Cúram implementation project. The Cúram Education Team currently offers the following two certification tests:

***C001 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Application Developer – Certification (see below)***

***C002 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Business Analysis – Certification (see below)***

Each test contains multiple-choice questions that require either a single answer or multiple answers. For multiple-answer questions, you need to choose all required options to answer the question correctly. You will be advised how many correct options you need to select to get the overall question right.

The test is a closed-book test, so you cannot refer to any course materials or other information during your test session. There is no negative marking or partial marking. The test language is English.

Each Certification Test has an associated Practice Test that you can use to prepare for the Certification Test.

### C001 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Application Developer – Certification

#### Test Preparation

To prepare for the Cúram Developer test, start with the following high-level steps:

+ Review the test sections and identify the associated objectives and topics.
+ Master the material and exercises in the following courses:
  + 9D73G - IBM Cúram SPM for Developers (ADE) 7.X
  + 9D74G - IBM Cúram SPM for Developers (Customization) 7.X

Hands-on experience of using the IBM Cúram SPM Application Development Environment (ADE) is an essential part of preparing for this test. Candidates must spend time using the IBM Cúram SPM ADE to apply the skills that are taught during the mandatory courses.

#### Practice Test

It is strongly recommended that certification candidates take the Practice Test (P001) before they attempt the Certification Test (C001). In the test codes, C stands for Certification and P stands for Practice.

The Practice Test contains the same number of questions as the Certification Test and is designed to have the same level of difficulty, which makes it a great way to prepare for the Certification Test. In addition, your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. It is suggested to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.

### C002 – IBM Cúram SPM V7.X Business Analysis – Certification

#### Test Overview and Structure

This entry-level certification test is intended for business analysts, consultants, services professionals, testers, and any other personnel who want to acquire the foundational Cúram knowledge that is required to work on Cúram implementation projects.

The following skills are essential for successful performance on this test:

+ Working knowledge of health and human services programs
+ Experience of the typical business analysis activities that relate to system implementations

The following skills are suggested for successful performance on this test:

+ Familiarity with enterprise applications and commercial off-the-shelf products

To prepare for this certification test, it is recommended that candidates study the following self-paced course:

#### Test Preparation

All test questions come from content in the main training manual for 9D72G – Fundamentals of the IBM Cúram SPM Platform for Business Analysts 7.X.

In addition to the course manual, it is strongly recommended that you study the Review the Concepts questions in the 9D72G exercise workbook.

Here is some advice that might help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ It is recommended that certification candidates take the **Practice Test (P002)** before they attempt the Certification Test (C002). In the test codes, C stands for Certification and P stands for Practice.
+ The Practice Test contains the same number of questions as the Certification Test and is designed to have the same level of difficulty. Your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. It is suggested to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.  
+ Try to take the test approximately 2-5 weeks after completing this training course. You need to allow yourself time to study. However, if you wait too long after the course, you’ll start to lose some of what you learned. Keep in mind that anything in the course manual is fair game for a test question but try to focus on the main ideas and details of each lesson.
+ The Review the Concepts questions within the training course are a good way to test yourself. Do NOT take the test until you can answer all of the in-course questions from memory.
+ For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tells you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…”and be followed by the prompt “Select 3.” Use these indicators to help you select or eliminate some of the options.
+ After you complete the test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the three tested sections. If you don’t pass the test, this report can help identify the areas that need more attention before you try again.
