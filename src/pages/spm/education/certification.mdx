You will be advised how many correct options you need to select to get the overall question right.

The test is a closed-book test, so you cannot refer to any course materials or other information during your test session. There is no negative marking or partial marking. The test language is English.

Each Certification Test has an associated Practice Test that you can use to prepare for the Certification Test.
