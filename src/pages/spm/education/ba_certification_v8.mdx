### Test Preparation

All test questions come from content in the main training manual and exercise workbook for CUR088 – Fundamentals of the Merative Cúram Platform for Business Analysts 8.X.

Here is some advice that might help you prepare for and pass the test:

+ It is recommended that certification candidates take the **Practice Test (P003)** before they attempt the **Certification Test (C003)**. In the test codes, C stands for Certification and P stands for Practice.
+ The Practice Test contains the same number of questions as the Certification Test and is designed to have the same level of difficulty. Your score on the Practice Test provides a clear indication of whether you are ready to take the Certification Test or need to put in more prep work. Aim to take the Practice Test about a week before you plan to take the actual test.  
+ Try to take the test approximately 2-5 weeks after completing CUR088 training course. You need to allow yourself time to study. However, if you wait too long after the course, you may start to lose some of what you learned.
+ Keep in mind that anything in the course manual or exercise workbook is fair game for a test question.
+ The Review the Concepts questions within the training course are a good way to test yourself. Do NOT take the test until you can answer all of the in-course questions from memory.
+ For questions that have multiple answers, you will see prompts that tell you how many answers you should select. For example, the question stem will begin with “Which three…” and be followed by the prompt “Select 3”. Use these indicators to help you select or reject options.
+ After you complete the test, you will receive a score report showing how you performed in each of the three sections. If you fail the test, this report can help you to identify the areas that need more study before you try again.
