WorkItem:274273 - Some drop-downs display a blank entry if no default value is specified  

**Issue Description:**  
Since version 8.0.0, some drop-downs display a blank value as the default option. Before version 8.0.0, the drop-downs displayed the first value in the code table as the default item. In UIM, when configuring a field to display the contents of a code table that displayed a default value, two settings are considered.  

*   Update the UIM field and set the value USE_DEFAULT. When set to true, a default value is displayed in the code table, otherwise, the first item in the drop-down is displayed,
*   Set the default attribute to an item in the corresponding code table.

In version 8.0.0, if USE_DEFAULT was false or no default value was specified in the code table, the drop-down field had no default selection and a blank value was displayed.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**  
  
**Scenario 1:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person and create an integrated case for them.

1.  Login as an administrator.
2.  Select Process Instance Errors under Process Monitoring in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Issue: The Process Name drop-down is blank.

**Resolution:**  
Now when the property USE_DEFAULT is set to false, or no default code table item is specified, the first item in the code table is used as the default selection.  
  

WorkItem:274388 - Modal dialog buttons transition improvements  

**Issue Description:**  
In version 8.0.0, modal dialogs and modal-based wizards have the following transition issues.  
  
While modal-based wizards are in transition, for example, loading the next page, the modal footer buttons style remains the same as the general button styling concerning color and layout. This implies that the user can interact with the modal footer buttons while the rest of the content in the modal is blurred by the progress spinner background or the loading mask. If a user clicks on any of the footer buttons during this transition time, they no longer display.  
  
The button transition issue can also be seen in a single modal scenario. The buttons disappear after a click but the screen itself is still displayed; the buttons become opaque and stay until the dialog closes.  
  
There is no difference in principle between the single modal and the wizard, the same is happening in both transitions. The only difference is that in the case of wizards, the modal stays with the new content, and in the case of the single modal, the action usually returns to the content pane which is optionally reloaded.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
  
**Scenario 1:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Click Person under Registration in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Click the Next button in the Register Person wizard.
4.  Issue: When the wizard is transitioning, all the modal buttons disappear and the new buttons are just drawn after the next screen with the full details loads.

**Scenario 2:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Create a new Task to open the New Task modal.
3.  Click the Save and New button.
4.  Issue: When the modal is transitioning, all the modal buttons disappear and the new buttons are just drawn after the next screen with the full details loads.

**Resolution:**  
The modal dialog buttons transition has been improved by delaying their removal from the modal footer until the new button set is to be drawn. The modal footer style has been updated to display a different style when the transition is ongoing. The opacity (transparency) has been increased while the dialog is in transition, for example, when new content is loading. When the dialog is closed or has new content loaded, this styling is removed. The buttons are now not disappearing as previously and are displayed on the modal until either the dialog closes or the new content loads into the same dialog.  
  
The buttons are now put in the transitional state which is marked by making them partly opaque and not active. The transition state lasts until the dialog is discarded (single modal scenario), or the new content with different buttons is loaded (modal-based wizard scenario).  
  

WorkItem:274393 - When a caseworker clicks to download the contract on the Preview Contract confirmation modal, the buttons are no longer visible on the modal  

**Issue Description:**  
When a caseworker views the Preview Contract confirmation modal and clicks the button to download a provider contract, the buttons on the confirmation modal disappear.

6.  Select the Preview row-level action for the Utilization Contract.
7.  Click the leftmost button on the Preview Contract confirmation dialog.
8.  Issue: The Provider contract downloads but the buttons disappear from the Preview Contract dialog.

**Resolution:**  
When a caseworker clicks on the leftmost button to preview the provider contract, the contract is downloaded and the buttons on the confirmation modal continue to be displayed.  
  
**Note:** The Preview Contract confirmation modal contains a button with a missing label. The button incorrectly displays the value 'Null' instead of the value 'Yes'. This is a Known Issue in Work Item 274492.  
  

WorkItem:274525 - The modal layout is not maintained for medium modals when the width of the browser is significantly reduced  

**Issue Description:**  
Caseworkers might need to resize their browser if they are interacting with multiple systems. The modal layout is not consistent for medium modals when the width of the browser window reduces significantly. As the modal size reduces, the fields reposition as expected. However, as the modal size continues to reduce, the fields revert to their original positions, resulting in a poor user experience.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Open the Client Contact tab of the person case and select Communications Exceptions.
4.  Click the New page action to open the New Communication Exception modal.
5.  Reduce the width of the browser window significantly.
6.  Issue: As the caseworker resizes the browser window the modal shrinks and the fields are repositioned. As the user continues to reduce the window size, the fields revert to their original position.

**Resolution:**  
As the size of a medium modal reduces, the modal fields reposition as expected and no longer revert as the size decreases further, giving a consistent user experience.

PO09532, WorkItem:273065 - Unable to compliantly extend Smart Navigator search by reference authorization check  

**Issue Description:**  
In version 7.0.7, an authorization check was included for the Smart Navigator search by reference and case keyword so that only those results that the caseworker has permission to view are returned in the results list. The default implementation performs authorization checks only for the following case types: Integrated Case (CT5), Product Delivery (CT2), Investigation (CT2000), Liability (CT4), Service Plan (CT1), and Application Case (CT10201).

**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
N/A  
  
**Resolution:**  
A new interface is now provided to allow compliant customization. For more information about how to use the new interface, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/spm/8.0.1?topic=navigator-customizing-case-search-results](https://www.ibm.com/docs/spm/8.0.1?topic=navigator-customizing-case-search-results).  
  

PO09395, PO07952, WorkItem:273118 - Evidence Source column is not correctly set for shared evidence records  

**Issue Description:**  
The source column for an evidence record does not correctly show where a piece of evidence was shared from.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  Configure evidence sharing from an integrated case to a person case with Trusted Source set to Yes for the Addresses evidence.

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a person and create a new integrated case.
3.  Navigate to the evidence dashboard on the integrated case.
4.  Create new address evidence with an address type that does not yet exist on the person case.
5.  Apply changes.
6.  Navigate to the active evidence on the person case.
7.  Issue: The new address is displayed but the source column incorrectly shows that the evidence originated from the person record.

**Resolution:**  
The code for creating the shared evidence descriptors now properly sets the SharedInd field. The source column now correctly displays the case that the evidence was last shared from.  
  

WorkItem:273436 - Verification Engine performance improvement addressing redundant calls to determine verification status during product authorization  

**Issue Description:**  
Verifications that are configured at the product delivery level are inserted as required during product authorization. On insertion of each new product level verification, the status of the new verification needs to be determined. However, the status of all verifications on the product delivery case and the parent-integrated case that are linked to the same evidence type is evaluated during each new insertion. While this does not cause a functional issue, it does cause a large amount of redundant processing that results in the product delivery authorization process taking longer than necessary to complete.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Submit an application for Food Assistance and Medical Assistance.
4.  Add evidence to be eligible for Food Assistance (Head of Household and Work Registration evidence) and Medical Assistance programs ABD (Disability evidence with type Blind and 1619b indicator checked) and QMB (Benefit evidence with Medicare Part A).
5.  Add monthly Earned Income evidence records of $1 (start and end dates matching calendar month dates) for the previous 6 years.
6.  Clear verifications and apply all evidence changes.
7.  Authorize the individual product deliveries.
8.  Issue: The time taken to authorize is considerable, and the time taken increases as each subsequent product delivery is authorized.

**Resolution:**  
Now as each new verification is inserted, the status of only _that_ verification is determined, which improves the overall performance of product authorization.  
  

WorkItem:273624 - Hook point required to facilitate setting the Case Header effective date as part of case approval  

**Issue Description:**  
Currently, it is not possible to compliantly customize the function that sets the Case Header effective date when approving a product delivery. Customers might want to set this to a specific value depending on their payment schedules.  
  
For example, a customer might pay out every 4 weeks on particular days of the month. Setting the effective date in line with those days ensures the desired payment behavior in accordance with those schedules.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce**: N/A  
  
**Resolution:**  
To support compliant customization, a new external, implementable interface curam.core.hook.impl.ProductDeliveryApprovalStrategyHook has been added. The method setEffectiveDate(final Long caseID, final Date approvalDate) can be implemented to customize the logic that sets the effective date on product deliveries during the case approval process. The custom implementation can be injected through the standard Guice dependency injection mechanism.  
  

WorkItem:274329 - Undo deprecation of meeting minutes responses feature  

**Issue Description:**  
The meeting invite response feature was deprecated in error in version 8.0.0. The feature forms part of meeting minutes PIM integration, which processes responses that are returned to a configured email account and updates meeting attendee response data. Some of the artifacts are used in batch jobs and were deprecated in error.  
  
For more information, see _WorkItem: 263097- Deprecate an unused facade method that processed email meeting responses as part of Meeting Minutes PIM integration_ in the version 8.0.0 Release Notes.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
N/A  
  
**Resolution:**  
The feature is no longer deprecated. All deprecation labels have been removed from the related artifacts.  
  

  

#### Dynamic Evidence

[Evidence Validations](#evidence_validations_improvedandresolvedissues)  

PO09463, WorkItem:272386 - Incorrect user and timestamp information is displayed when evidence is edited and the edit is then discarded  

**Issue Description:**  
Incorrect user and timestamp information is displayed in the Updated By field of a Corrections record when viewing the change history for an evidence record where a user selects to edit active evidence and then discard the in-edit evidence changes.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support intake worker.
2.  Register a Person and create a new Income Support integrated case.
3.  Click the Evidence tab and select Dashboard.
4.  Create any new evidence from the dashboard.
5.  Apply changes.
6.  Login as a second user such as an Income Support eligibility worker.
7.  Search for the case and edit the evidence to change any of the information.
8.  After saving, notice the 'In-Edit' status in the Change Summary section and that Updated By is the name of the second user.
9.  Discard the changes.
10.  Issue: The name of the user that is displayed in the Updated By field for the initial Corrections record is incorrectly updated to the name of the second user that edited and then discarded the edit.

**Resolution:**  
The Updated By field that is displayed for each Corrections record now shows the user who applied the changes for the initial creation of the evidence and each subsequent correction, including when evidence is edited and then those edits are discarded.  
  

WorkItem:273340 - Improvements to evidence change history  

**Issue Description:**  
Previously when viewing a change history of evidence the following two items made it more difficult for caseworkers to understand the changes that occurred to the evidence:  
  
1) The labels that are used for tab names were not consistent across person, dynamic evidence, and static evidence leading to potential confusion about whether the information displayed across case types was the same. For static evidence, such as that captured in an Income Support case, the label that was used for the tab that is used to view corrections information was labeled ‘History’, however, for dynamic evidence, such as that displayed within an Insurance Affordability case, the tab name was displayed as ‘Corrections’. Additionally, when evidence was viewed at the person level, the label for the tab that is used to view the overall change history was labeled ‘Corrections’.  
  
2) When evidence is expanded, a change history of the evidence, including the user who modified the evidence, is displayed. Previously, when the evidence was created by one user and then corrected by other users, the last user to correct the evidence was being displayed for all correction records making it difficult to view a history of all users who are involved in updating the evidence.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce (Issue 1: Tab names):**  
  
**(Issue 1a: Person evidence tab names):**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Click the Evidence tab and expand any of the evidence types.
4.  Issue: The set of tab names display as: Details, Corrections, Issues, Verifications. When the Corrections tab is then expanded another tab name Corrections is then also displayed.

**(Issue 1b: Static evidence tab names):**  

1.  For the person created above, create an integrated case that uses static evidence.
2.  Create any evidence record and apply changes.
3.  Expand the evidence to view the change history. Expand the evidence again at the next level.
4.  Issue: The set of tab names display as: Details, History. This is inconsistent with dynamic evidence that displays Details and Corrections.

**Steps to Reproduce (Issue 2: Change History)**  

1.  Record the case number of the integrated case created above.
2.  Logout and login as a different user who has access to the same integrated case type.
3.  Open the same integrated case and the same evidence.
4.  Select to edit the evidence and make a correction to the evidence.
5.  Expand the evidence to view the change history that now includes two corrections records - one for the initial version of the evidence and one for the correction.
6.  Issue: Both corrections records display the name of the user that made the correction.

**Resolution:**  
For static evidence, the tab name previously labeled 'History' has been updated to now display ‘Corrections'.  
  
For person evidence, the top-level tab name previously labeled 'Corrections' has been updated to now display 'Change History'.  
  
When a user different from the user that initially created evidence modifies the evidence by making a correction, the name of the user that initially created the evidence is no longer overwritten.  
  
**Note:** Taking on the change to the naming of the tab for person-level evidence is optional but if taken on requires the insertion of updated lob data into the database. The associated upgrade steps are outlined in the _IBM Cúram Upgrade Guide_ in the chapter entitled _PDC Dynamic Evidence Navigation Label Update_.  
  

  

##### Evidence Validations

PO09471, WorkItem:272306 - Unhandled server exception when modifying an in-edit dynamic evidence into new version  

**Issue Description:**  
An unhandled server exception occurs when a user creates and then attempts to modify in-edit dynamic evidence on a case. This exception occurs when a second version of a dynamic evidence type is configured by an administrator that involves the removal of attributes that were used by validations in the previous version.

#### Technical Services

[Workflow](#workflow_improvedandresolvedissues)  

PO08759, WorkItem:259492 - Inconsistent username size limit in SPM is 64 characters causing errors when attempting to load pages  

**Issue Description:**  
When using Oracle or H2 databases, usernames can be up to 64 characters long. However, some database fields in Social Program Management are too small to contain a username longer than 40 characters and cause errors when attempting to load pages.  
  
Note DB2 databases are typically not impacted by this issue because DB2 databases allocate four bytes of storage per character on the database and are not usually affected by this issue unless the username consists of mostly multi-byte characters.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an administrator to an SPM deployed server using an Oracle database.
2.  Click New User under Users in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Create a user with a name length of 51 characters and a Role Name of SUPERROLE. Enter the mandatory fields and enable the account.
4.  Assign the user a position.
5.  Login as the user you created.
6.  Register a new Person.
7.  Issue: An unhandled exception is displayed.

**Resolution:**  
The sizes of the username fields have been increased to 64 characters. The affected fields have been increased to 64 characters as follows:  

*   CREOLERuleSetSnapshot.username
*   CREOLERuleSetEditAction.username
*   PrecedentChangeItem.changedByUsername
*   UserPageConfig.username

Note one of the affected tables, PrecedentChangeItem, typically contains a large number of records and resizing a field on this table can take a long time to process. Archiving the dependency manager data first can reduce the processing time.  
  
  

  

##### Workflow

PO08167, WorkItem:244487 - The existing overflow indicator flag is not taken into account when modifying existing Process Instance WDO Data Overflow  

**Issue Description:**  
When a workflow is processed, the first entry that is written to the Process Instance WDO Data Overflow entity works correctly. The issue occurs when subsequent updates occur. When the threshold limit of 3900 characters is reached, an overflow indicator flag is set on the Process Instance WDO Data entity. The flag is not taken into account when modifying an existing Process Instance WDO Data Overflow, which results in Duplicate Record Exceptions occurring in the server logs.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Create a workflow that writes to the Process Instance WDO Data Overflow entity and that increases in size between insertions.
2.  The first insertion must be shorter than 3900 characters and then later insertions must cause the overflow to have more than 3900 characters.
3.  Issue: A DuplicateRecordException occurs in the server logs.

**Resolution:**  
When a workflow now causes the Process Instance WDO Data Overflow to exceed the 3900 character threshold, the Process Instance WDO Data Overflow processes the overflow indicator flag correctly.  
  
**Technical:**  
The overflow indicator is now calculated based on the record to update instead of the existing record. A Duplicate Record Exception no longer occurs in the server logs.

##### Eligibility & Entitlement

PO08910, WorkItem:263819 - The format of dates that are displayed in the Eligibility Viewer's evidence based key event data is not configurable  

**Issue Description:**  
The Eligibility Viewer gives caseworkers a holistic view of eligibility for a person or for an integrated case and includes the display of key events that are changes to an integrated case that might affect eligibility. The format of dates that are displayed in the eligibility viewer's evidence-based key event data is not configurable and defaults to US format, MM/dd/yyyy.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  The Eligibility Viewer must be configured for an integrated case.
2.  The date format must be set to a format other than MM/dd/yyyy in both the server's Bootstrap.properties and the client's ApplicationConfiguration.properties.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Create an instance of the integrated case configured in the prerequisites for the person.
4.  Add the necessary evidence to make the person eligible and apply changes.
5.  Add an associated product delivery to the integrated case.
6.  Add certification to the product delivery if required.
7.  Submit, approve, and activate the product delivery.
8.  Click the Eligibility tab on the integrated case to see the Eligibility Viewer.
9.  On the viewer, select a product delivery.
10.  Issue: Key event dates continue to display in US format.

**Resolution:**  
In the Eligibility Viewer, key event dates are now formatted by using the date format properties that are specified in the Bootstrap properties file. The new formatting is for both the integrated case and person views.  
  
**Technical:**  
For consistent date formatting by the Eligibility Viewer, both client and server date formats must be set to the same value. For more information, see [https:_www.ibm.com/docs/spm/8.0.1?topic=viewer-customizing-display-evidence-based-key-events_](https:<i>www.ibm.com/docs/spm/8.0.1?topic=viewer-customizing-display-evidence-based-key-events)_.

PO09256, WorkItem:268833 - Error message not displaying when attempting to delete a user with tasks  

**Issue Description:**  
When an administrator tries to delete an internal user when tasks or cases are assigned to that user, the system prevents the delete from occurring and initiates a workflow process to inform the user’s supervisor that they need to action the assigned tasks and cases. However, no validation message is displayed to inform the administrator that the delete cannot occur and to confirm the initiation of the workflow process.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  Login as an administrator.
2.  Click the Inbox workspace.
3.  Select New Task under Tasks in the shortcuts menu.
4.  Create a new task and assign it to an existing user.
5.  Click Save.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an administrator.
2.  Click User Search under Users in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Search for the user above for which there is an assigned task.
4.  Select the user to open the user's homepage.
5.  Select Delete from the page action menu.
6.  Confirm the deletion in the Delete User modal.
7.  Issue: The user delete does not occur as expected; however the user sees no message as to why the delete failed.

**Resolution:**  
Now when an administrator tries to delete an internal user that has tasks or cases assigned, the user sees a validation message that describes why the user cannot be deleted. For more information, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=accounts-deleting-user](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=accounts-deleting-user).  
  
**Technical:**  
The Delete User modal has been changed so that it invokes the following new facade operation when it is launched:  

*   Organization.cancelUserPreCheck()

This method validates that the deletion of the user can proceed.  

*   If there are any validation errors, such as if the user has any tasks or cases assigned, it will display any validation errors in the Delete User modal and ask whether to send a task to the supervisor informing them of the need to reassign tasks or cases. Clicking Yes initiates the Remove User workflow to send the task to the supervisor.
*   If there are no validation errors, clicking Yes in the modal initiates the Remove User workflow to proceed with the user deletion.

  

  

#### Intake

PO06416, WorkItem:207558 - Find Client pod gets minimized and the home page reloads  

**Issue Description:**  
Using the Find Client pod to enter a person's Reference, First Name, Middle Initials, or Last Name and then pressing the Enter key minimizes the pod and reloads the home page.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an intake worker.
2.  On the home page in the Find Client pod, enter text into the Last Name field.
3.  Press the Enter key on the keyboard.
4.  Issue: The Find Client pod minimizes and the home page reloads rather than displaying a search result.

**Resolution:**  
The search criteria now entered in the Find Client pod runs a search of the system to return any results for the person details that are entered.  
  
**Technical:**  
This issue is now resolved by adding onKeyPress listeners to the Reference, First Name, Middle Initial, Last Name, and Date of Birth fields on the Find Client pod. When the Enter key is pressed, JavaScript clicks **Search** on the Find Client pod.

WorkItem:273496 - The GraphQL build script did not include the data fetcher classes from all server components  

**Issue Description:**  
The 'rest' and 'restEAR' Ant build targets that build the GraphQL data fetcher Java classes in the REST application did not use the correct list of server components and were not including GraphQL data fetcher Java classes from custom components.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Resolution:**  
The relevant Ant build script has been updated to compile GraphqQL data fetcher Java classes from all components that are included in the SERVER_COMPONENT_ORDER environment variable.  
  

WorkItem:273513 - The default-secure-sanitize-allowlist.properties Application Resource is not being loaded from the Application Resource Cache whenever possible  

**Issue Description:**  
In version 8.0.0 of the product, the sanitization library was updated. This updated library sanitizes data and property values throughout the application to remove HTML which is potentially malicious. This sanitization library is customizable through an allowlist by adding HTML elements and attributes which are deemed to be safe and removing HTML elements and attributes which are deemed to be potentially malicious. The allowlist of HTML elements and attributes is defined in the 'default-secure-sanitize-allowlist.properties' application resource file. It has been found that the default-secure-sanitize-allowlist.properties Application Resource is not being loaded from the Application Resource Cache whenever possible. This results in an unnecessary number of database calls to retrieve this information.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
N/A  
  
**Resolution:**  
The default-secure-sanitize-allowlist.properties Application Resource is now loaded from the Application Resource Cache whenever possible which reduces the number of database calls.

**Resolution:**  
The clipboard functionality is now supported on modern browsers on any pages where this functionality is set.  
  

  

##### Widgets

WorkItem:273101 - Session Timeout modal dialog is incorrectly sized and the buttons for external application are not displayed  

**Issue Description:**  
The Session Timeout modal dialog that warns the user that their session is about to expire is incorrectly sized. The Continue and Quit buttons to take any user action are not displayed. The issue occurs in the external application, for example, the Universal Access classic application.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Configure the application server to reduce the session timeout to a short interval or take note of the preset timeout interval (usually 30 minutes).
2.  Navigate to the first screen of the Universal Access classic application (no login is required) and click a button to start the application.
3.  Leave the second screen idle for the timeout interval set or noted in Step 1.
4.  After the timeout period, the modal dialog that warns the user that their session is about to expire is displayed.
5.  Issue: The dialog is oversized and does not have any control to either log out or extend the current session. The only course of action for the user is to wait for the auto-logout when the count-down that is displayed reaches 0.

**Resolution:**  
The modal dialog size has been restored to the appropriate size and the Continue and Quit buttons are displayed again to allow the user to take the appropriate action.  
  

  

##### Core Development Infrastructure

PO09389, WorkItem:271026 - H2 database driver should not be part of release  

**Issue Description:**  
The H2 database driver was included in the directory created by the release target. This driver is only used for development and should not be included in the directory created by the release target.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Run the SPM installers.
2.  Run the 'build server' target.
3.  Run the 'build client' target.
4.  Run the 'build {websphere|weblogic} EAR' target.
5.  Run the 'build release' target.
6.  Issue: The H2 database driver was included in the release target directory.

**Resolution:**  
The issue is resolved by excluding the H2 database driver when populating the release directory.  
  
**Technical:**  
As part of this change, the following file has been updated:  

*   CuramSDEJ/bin/app_release.xml

  

WorkItem:273762 - Update the third_party_tools_version.properties file with the supported prerequisite versions  

**Issue Description:**  
The configtest target does not reflect the supported third-party prerequisite versions for IBM Cúram Social Program Management (SPM) version 8.0.0 and allows false positives to be returned on some dropped third-party software.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  On a freshly installed version of IBM Cúram SPM, with all third-party software installed and Bootstrap.properties in place, run 'build configtest'.
2.  Issue: No issues are reported even though the installed version of WebSphere does not match what's in the third_party_tools_version.properties file. The same issue occurs if running with WebLogic.

**Resolution:**  
This issue is resolved by making the following changes to the third_party_tools_version.properties file:  

`    version-weblogic  {12.1.3.0.0,12.2.1.3.0 => 12.2.1.0.0,14.1.1.0.0}   version-websphere {8.5.5.0,9.0 => 9.0.5}   version-ORA-12    {12 => Removed}   version-ZOS-11    {11.1 => Removed}    `

  
  
The properties version-ORA-12 and version-ZOS-11 have been removed as they are now defunct.  
  

  

##### Server Development Environment

[XML Server](#xml_server_improvedandresolvedissues)  

PO09458, WorkItem:272103 - Code table view does not work if the code table is used in a FIELD with USE_BLANK="true"  

**Issue Description:**  
An error occurs if a blank value is chosen from the drop-down field where a code table view is configured for a code table.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  
1. Activate the code table view for code table Gender and the application context APC01 by updating the following files:  
  
a) ../EJBServer/components/core/codetable/CT_Gender.ctx  
  
After line 54 inside CT_Gender.ctx, add the following:  

`    <views>   <view context="APC01">   <code value="SX2"/>   </view>   </views>    `

  
  
**Note:** Any code table can be used here. Gender is used for convenience.  
  
b) .. /EJBServer/components/PFMAppViews/tab/DefaultAppView/DefaultApp.app  
  
Replace the following line inside DefaultApp.app:  

`    user-message="DefaultApp.UserMessage">    `

  
  
with  

`    user-message="DefaultApp.UserMessage" context="APC01">    `

  
  
**Note:** Any .app can be updated. DefaultApp.app is used here.  
  
2. From the EJBServer directory, run the command:  

*   build ctgen (Note: build server can also be used)

3. From the EJBServer directory, run the command:  

*   build database

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Select Person under Search in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Leave the Gender drop-down blank.
4.  Enter First Name and Last Name and click the Search button.
5.  Issue: The following error message is displayed - ERROR: The format of an error message is invalid or the placeholder substitution failed: ERROR: The code '%1s' was not found in the code-table '%2s' view '%3'.

**Resolution:**  
The issue is resolved by including conditional logic in the infrastructure for the case where a blank value is chosen for the code table view. Now when a blank value is submitted for a optional drop-down field where a code table view is configured, no error message is displayed.  
  
  

  

##### XML Server

WorkItem:271979 - XML Server ThreadPoolWorker data not immediately available for monitoring  

**Issue Description:**  
A new XML server startup argument (-forcestatswrite) has been added for the  

`stats/ThreadPoolWorker-*`

  
records to be flushed from the buffer with each write. This argument is intended for Kubernetes environments where the expectation for performance data (for example, Prometheus) is to be available as it occurs. There is no change to the default behavior.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Run the Cúram application and XML server.
2.  Observe that as the application runs and starts the XML server (for example, by creating a referral) that no data is produced in the following files:
    *   `stats/ThreadPoolWorker-*`
        
3.  Stop the XML server.
4.  Issue: Observe that when stopped, if there was XML server activity, there is data in the following files:
    *   `stats/ThreadPoolWorker-*`
        

**Resolution:**  
Starting the XML server with -Dadditional.args="-forcestatswrite" now flushes the statistics buffer with each write and there is data in the following file:  

`stats/ThreadPoolWorker-*`

##### Word Integration

WorkItem:272357 - Silent install of Word Integration Assistant ignores INSTALLDIR install property for Per Machine (system level) install  

**Issue Description:**  
When using the silent install option of Word Integration Assistant Installer in version 8.0.0 and performing a system-level install, the INSTALLDIR property that is specified at the outset is ignored and it will always install to 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\WordBridge'. This is not an issue for the UI Wizard install and does not affect Per User install (silent or UI install).  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Install Microsoft Word at the system level.
2.  Install a Java Runtime Environment version 8 at the system level. Note the path to the JRE folder for a later step.
3.  Install Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on Chromium at the system level.
4.  Open a command window running as administrator and specify this command:
    *   `msiexec /i IBMCuramWordIntegrationAssistant.msi ALLUSERS=1 INSTALLDIR="C:\v80WordInteg" WORD_BRIDGE_JAVA_HOME="C:\IBM_JAVA\jre" /qn /l*v SilentInstallPerSystem.log`
        
    *   Substitute C:\\IBM_JAVA\\jre with the path to the JRE folder noted in step 2.
5.  Issue: The Word Integration Assistant should be installed to C:\\v80WordInteg, but it is installed to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\IBM\\WordBridge.

**Resolution:**  
The installer has been updated so that for both user-level and system-level silent installations, the INSTALLDIR install property is honored.

#### Outcome Management

PO08585, WorkItem:254353 - Recommended activities not automatically added to an outcome plan when configured to do so  

**Issue Description:**  
Outcome Plan Recommendations can be configured for services, referrals, and actions to indicate that a caseworker is advised to add the recommended activities to the outcome plan. An application property is also available to indicate that any recommended activities are automatically added to an Outcome Plan when it is created. Currently, when the application property is enabled, the recommended activities are not being automatically added to the Outcome Plan.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  Login as an administrator.
2.  Click Outcome Plans under Outcome Management in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Select an existing outcome plan and navigate to the Recommendations tab.
4.  Click the actions menu and select to configure two recommendations for the outcome plan.
5.  Navigate to the Cases tab and note which case types are assigned to the outcome plan.
6.  Login as a system administrator.
7.  Click Property Administration under Application Data in the shortcuts panel.
8.  Change the property 'curam.outcomeplanning.outcomePlanAutoPopulateEnabled' to 'true' and publish the change.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a person.
3.  Add a new case of the type that is assigned to the outcome plan.
4.  Create a new Outcome plan for this case.
5.  Issue: The recommended activities are not added automatically to the outcome plan.

**Resolution:**  
When an outcome plan is now created, the recommended activities are automatically added and displayed under the Activities tab.  
  
**Technical:**  
This was resolved by adding the appropriate logic to the OutcomePlan.createFromRelatedCase facade to check the system property and add the activities accordingly. This issue was happening because the facade method, OutcomePlan.createFromRelatedCase, used in creating the outcome plan for an existing case was missing the logic to add the activities if the system property was enabled.  
  

PO08883, WorkItem:268295 - It is not possible to unset the expected end date on an Outcome Plan once it has been set  

**Issue Description:**  
On an Outcome Plan when an Expected End Date is entered, the Expected End Date displays in the context panel. When a user attempts to remove the Expected End Date, the date does not get removed and still displays in the context panel.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Create a new integrated case for the person.
4.  Click the Outcome Plans tab and select the New page action.
5.  Populate the mandatory fields and leave the Expected End Date blank.
6.  Select the client and click Save.
7.  Edit the outcome plan and enter an Expected End date.
8.  Click Save.
9.  Note that the Expected End Date is displayed correctly.
10.  Edit the outcome plan again and remove the Expected End Date.
11.  Click Save.
12.  Issue: The Expected End Date is still displayed.

**Resolution:**  
The logic for updating the Expected End Date on an outcome plan has been modified to allow the Expected End Date to be cleared.  
  

WorkItem:272368 - Deprecate property no longer used in the outcome planning workspace  

**Issue Description:**  
The property ‘curam.outcomeplanning.defaultTimelineView’ is only applicable to the older Flex-based outcome planning workspace which was removed from the product in version 8.0.0. The newer Dojo JavaScript outcome planning workspace displays an updated layout and this property is not referenced by that workspace.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Resolution:**  
The property 'curam.outcomeplanning.defaultTimelineView' has been deprecated.  
  

Artefacts were deprecated as a result of this change. For more information, please see [this](#TECH_272368) ticket in the "Notes on Deprecation" section.

  

#### Verification

PO09154, WorkItem:267601 - Verification Item with 'To Date' in the past causes existing Verified Verifications to change to Not Verified  

**Issue Description:**  
When a user selects to view verifications within a case, the status of each verification is redetermined using expiry date information in order to display the current verification status to the user. The status incorrectly changes from Verified to Not Verified when the 'To Date' of the item used to verify is now in the past. The 'To Date' of the verification item utilization is only intended to control the items displayed to a caseworker when adding proof and should not be used in the calculation that determines if the item used to verify has expired.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  A verification must be configured against the evidence being added to the case.
2.  For the item used to verify, set the verification item utilization 'To Date' to the current date and leave the Expiry Days and Warning Days fields blank.

**Steps to Reproduce (Generic):**  

1.  Login as a caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Click the Care and Protection tab and select Cases.
4.  Using the New page action, create an integrated case.
5.  Click the Evidence tab on the integrated case.
6.  From the Evidence Dashboard, add an evidence record that requires verification (as configured in the prerequisite(s) section above).
7.  Navigate to the Verifications list page and satisfy the verification by adding proof (as configured in the prerequisite(s) section above).
8.  Apply changes.
9.  Roll the server date forward by one day.
10.  From the Verifications tab select All. Notice that the verification correctly displays as Verified. Then select the toggle and expand and then collapse the verification.
11.  From the Verifications tab, select the refresh icon and refresh the tab.
12.  Issue: The status of the verification incorrectly changes from Verified to Not Verified.

**Resolution:**  
The verification status remains the same when the 'To Date' of the item used to verify is in the past.  
  
For more information, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=requirements-verification-requirement-properties](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=requirements-verification-requirement-properties).  
  
**Technical:**  
Only those fields within the Expiry Details section of the verification item utilization administration screen are now considered when determining if an item used to verify a piece of evidence has expired, that is 'Expiry Days' and 'Expiry Date From'. The 'To Date' of the verification item utilization is no longer considered in this calculation.  
  

  

#### Universal Access

[Responsive Web Application](#responsive_web_application_improvedandresolvedissues)  

PO07839, WorkItem:232929 - Universal Access classic application help text is cut off on the final summary page  

**Issue Description:**  
In the Universal Access classic application, if a citizen mouses over or clicks the help text that is defined for certain UI elements on the final summary page, the system displays both the help text and tooltip together in an overlapping manner making readability difficult.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  In the Universal Access classic application, submit an application and reach the final results page.
2.  On the final summary page, mouse over and click any of the help text question marks.
3.  Issue: The help text and tooltip overlap, which makes readability difficult.

**Resolution:**  
This issue is resolved and now the help text and tooltip no longer overlap when the help text question mark is clicked.  
  

WorkItem:272477 - Universal Access Summary PDFs incorrectly generated from screenings instead of intake applications  

**Issue Description:**  
Previously when users of IBM Citizen Engagement or classic Universal Access completed a screening before later completing an intake application, the PDF summary was incorrectly generated. The PDF was generated by using the information pre-populated from the screening instead of the information that they later provided in the intake application.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No.  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Configure the new Summary PDF Template by:
    *   Login as a system administrator, go to Communications > XSL Templates.
    *   Search for the Intake Application template with the following details:
    *   Description: Intake Application
    *   Relates To: Intake Application
    *   Category: Intake Application
    *   Subcategory: Intake Application
    *   Template Type: Letter
    *   Template ID: Intake Application
    *   Select the template and check it out.
    *   Locate the template that you want to upload.
    *   This can be your own custom template or, for Universal Access Responsive Web Application, the improved template. For example, to use the improved IntakeApplicationPDFTemplate.xsl template, download it from /EJBServer/components/WorkspaceServices/data/initial/blob/IntakeApplicationPDFTemplate.xsl so you can upload it here.
    *   Click Check-in template and upload the new or updated template.
2.  Create an Account on Universal Access
3.  Select a Screening configured to pre-populate an intake application.
4.  Start the Intake Application (Social Assistance Application) after the screening is completed
5.  Complete the Application and submit it
6.  The PDF generated is a one-liner and it shows the Summary screen of the Screening, not the Application
7.  Issue: The PDF is generated only with the information of the Screening instead of the Intake Application.

**Resolution:**

PO09345, WorkItem:273477 - Public citizen authentication failure during concurrent load  

**Issue Description:**  
During concurrent load testing of the Citizen Engagement (CE) web application, public citizen authentication failures are observed in the server logs. The errors take the following form:  
  
CWL0008 - An encryption error was encountered while SecurityStrategy invocation was being performed in Citizen Workspace. This record has been changed by another user. Please start again.. \[err\] javax.security.auth.login.FailedLoginException: This record has been changed by another user. Please start again.  
  
This error occurs during the invocation of the modify operation on the External User entity.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Use the Citizen Engagement web application during concurrent load.
2.  Issue: Observe that authentication errors for the public citizen user are logged in the server log file.

**Resolution:**  
A new environment variable 'curam.citizenworkspace.publicuser.lastloginupdate.disabled' has been introduced that has a default value of 'true'. When the variable is set to 'true', the authentication and authorization mechanisms that record the last public user successful login are disabled so that authentication errors do not occur.

**Issue Description:**  
When executing an Intelligent Evidence Gathering (IEG) script definition containing a date field nested in a conditional cluster, if that date field is hidden/disabled by its conditional control, the value in the date field is not reset.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s)**:

#### Evidence Broker

PO09358, WorkItem:273116 - Unable to share evidence from multiple source Participant Data Cases in a single transaction  

**Issue Description:**  
Advanced evidence sharing enhancements made to the Evidence Broker introduced extra filtering for determining what evidence to share. Before these enhancements, it was possible under some scenarios to share evidence from multiple source Participant Data Cases (PDCs) in a single transaction to one target case, such as an integrated case. Now when advanced evidence sharing is enabled, this type of sharing can no longer occur. This can cause issues for custom processing that was implemented before the release of the enhancements to the Evidence Broker.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  
There are no steps to reproduce this issue. This can be reproduced only with custom code that creates or modifies evidence records on multiple person cases within the same transaction.  
  
**Resolution:**  
The Evidence Broker functionality has been updated to support the ability to share evidence from multiple source PDCs in a single transaction to one target case. A new application property 'curam.aes.advancedEvidenceSharingPDCException' has been added. Any evidence types specified in this property, which also exist on PDCs, will be eligible for sharing from multiple source cases in the same transaction. Note this feature does not support reciprocal evidence such as Relationships as they are handled in a different way.

[Medical Assistance](#medical_assistance_improvedandresolvedissues)  

PO08886, WorkItem:263335 - Validation to enforce alignment of household member and living arrangement evidence only gets called when household member evidence changes are applied  

**Issue Description:**  
For each case member in an Income Support case, Living Arrangement evidence must cover the full period of time that the case member is a household member as defined by their Household Member evidence on the case.  
  
A validation intended to prevent activation of evidence resulting in living arrangement periods not covering the entire household member period was only being called when applying changes to Household Member evidence. This incorrectly allowed for Living Arrangement evidence to be modified on its own so that the dates no longer covered the entire household member period.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.
3.  Create, submit, and authorize an Income Support application for the person.
4.  Navigate to the Income Support integrated case evidence dashboard, clear all verifications, and apply all evidence changes.
5.  Edit the living arrangement evidence adding an end date.
6.  Issue: The evidence is incorrectly allowed to activate even though it no longer covers the entire period of the household member evidence.

**Resolution:**  
The validation check is now called whenever changes to living arrangement evidence, household member evidence, or both are applied. The existing validation logic has also been rewritten to enhance the validation check. Previously, where there were multiple living arrangement evidence records for an individual, the validation only considered the earliest start date and latest end date and did not account for gaps between living arrangement evidence records. The enhancement to the validation logic now fully prevents activation of living arrangement evidence and/or household membership evidence if it will result in any period of household membership not covered by a living arrangement.  
  

PO09051, WorkItem:266091 - Future date of birth can be entered for Absent Parent evidence  

**Issue Description:**  
In an Income Support Application, adding Absent Parent evidence with a future date of birth is allowed. This also occurs when adding the Absent Parent evidence on the Income Support case.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Attempt to register a new Person with a date of birth in the future, 1/1/2025, for example.
3.  Clicking Save results in the following validation message being thrown: 'Date of Birth must not be later than today'.
4.  Create an Income Support Application by registering a new Person with a date of birth in the future,1/1/2025, for example.
5.  Update the date of birth with a correct value, 1/1/1990, for example.
6.  Complete the person registration.
7.  Create a new Income Support Application for the person.
8.  Select checkbox 'Are there any other people living in the household' when creating the application.
9.  Fill in all required fields for the parent and the child participants.
10.  Answer Yes to the question 'Are there any children in the claimant’s home who have a parent not living in the home?'.
11.  Fill in the mandatory fields for the Absent Parent and set the date of birth to the future date.
12.  Issue 1: The script goes to the next page without any validation for the Absent Parent unlike the new person created in step 2 for the Income Support application.
13.  Complete the application.
14.  Open the Income Support case and add another Absent Parent evidence.
15.  Enter a future date for the date of birth, 5/5/5555, for example.
16.  Click Save and then review the Absent Parent evidence.
17.  Issue 2: The evidence saves as normal without any date of birth validation for the Absent Parent on the Income Support case.

**Resolution:**  
A future date of birth can no longer be added on the Absent Parent details page in an Income Support application or when creating Absent Parent evidence in an Income Support case. A validation has been introduced on the Absent Parent page in the application that reads: 'The Absent Parent date of birth must not be in the future.'.  
  
Validation for a future date of birth has been added to the insert and the modify logic for Absent Parent evidence. A new validation message, ERR_ABSENTPARENT_XRV_DOB_MUST_NOT_BE_IN_FUTURE, that reads 'The participant date of birth must not be in the future.' has been added for this validation.  
  
  

  

##### Medical Assistance

PO08916, WorkItem:263937 - Incorrect timer is created when adding a Retroactive Medical Assistance program to an application that has already been submitted  

**Issue Description:**  
Milestones are created and displayed to the user on a Timers page when an Income Support application is submitted. These timers are used to impose time limits within which an application for a program must be processed.  
  
When an application for Medical Assistance is submitted, a Milestone Medical Assistance timer is created. When a Retroactive Medical Assistance program is then added to the Income Support application, a Milestone CHIP timer is incorrectly created instead of another Milestone Medical Assistance timer to represent the new program.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person.

**Technical:**  
The following configuration file has been updated to address this: ISIntakeConfiguration/data/initial/clob/ISEligibilityConfiguration.xml. Specifically, the Milestone ID for Program Type PT4001 has been updated from 1125899906842884 (Milestone CHIP timer) to 1125899906842883 (Milestone Medical Assistance timer).  
  

PO08942, WorkItem:264596 - Medical Assistance application submitted with past date showing eligibility results in the incorrect column  

**Issue Description:**  
When a caseworker processes an initial Medical Assistance application on the integrated case, rather than on the application, and Check Eligibility results in an eligible determination that ends before the current date, it is not possible to authorize the eligible unit as it displays under Future Eligibility.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Register a person with a registration date about a month ago.
3.  Submit a basic application for both Food Assistance and Medical Assistance for the person registered, with an application date the same date as person registration.
4.  Add evidence so that the Food Assistance application is eligible.
5.  Add Disability evidence for the claimant. Disability type: Blind; 1619(b) Recipient checked; Start Date: a date prior to the application date; End Date: a date prior to the current month.
6.  Add proof for any outstanding verifications and apply changes.

8.  From the person home page navigate directly to the integrated case, rather than the application.
9.  Check eligibility for Medical Assistance for 12 months with a start date matching the application date.
10.  Expand the Eligibility Checks decision for Medical Assistance.
11.  Issue: The person is correctly found eligible for Medical Assistance but the eligible period displays under Future Eligibility and cannot be authorized.

**Resolution:**  
The eligible decision is now displayed under the Eligible heading and can be authorized from the row-level action. This has been resolved by treating past periods of eligibility in the same way as current periods of eligibility.  
  

PO09142, WorkItem:267415 - Long Term Care expensive home exception is not being given for an adult child that is blind living in the home  

**Issue Description:**  
An individual is incorrectly determined ineligible for Medical Assistance Long Term Care due to the ownership of an expensive home even though they satisfy the exemption criteria based on an adult child who is blind living in the home.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  The current Rate Table CER Home Equity Resource Limit is less than 700000.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Income Support caseworker.
2.  Register an adult.
3.  Submit a Medical Assistance application for the adult registered and include an adult child in the application.
4.  On the application add the following evidence from the application date:
    *   Disability for the claimant. Disability Type: Acquired Brain Injury; Brain Injury Category: Brain Injury which Produces a Motor Deficit; Established Disability Mode: State Approved Disability Determination Body.
    *   Level of Care for the claimant. Level of Care Type: Intermediate or Skilled Nursing Care.
    *   Medical Institution Evidence. Waiver Type: Brain Injury Waiver; Expected Length of Stay: > 6 months; Application Filed by Type: Self.
    *   Property for the claimant. Property Type: Home and Surrounding Property; Fair Market Value: 700000; Category: Real.
    *   Ownership record for the claimant for the property. Percentage Owned: 100; Usage: Home; Ownership Type: Owner.
    *   Disability for the child. Disability Type: Blind; Disability Duration: Permanent SSA or Permanent Non-SSA.
5.  Check eligibility for Medical Assistance.
6.  Issue: Medical Assistance Long Term Care is ineligible due to the ownership of an expensive home.

**Resolution:**  
The expensive home exception rule has been modified to correct the relationship logic. Previously the relationship test expected the relationship between the individual being determined for LTC and the reciprocal participant to be 'child of'. This has now been corrected to 'parent of'. The remaining logic for determining whether the exception is satisfied based on the child living in the household was reviewed and considered correct. This same rule is used for Long Term Care, Medically Needy Long Term Care, and Medically Needy Long Term Care with Spend Down.  
  
The following rules have been modified to address this.  

*   Rule Set: LTCRuleSet
*   Rule Class: LTCCPRCalculator

4.  Check eligibility for Medical Assistance.
5.  Issue: Medical Assistance Long Term Care is ineligible due to the ownership of an expensive home.

**Resolution:**  
The expensive home exception rule was modified so that it can now be satisfied when the spouse lives in the home. The rule continues to be satisfied by the existing condition related to ownership of the property. This same rule is used for Long Term Care, Medically Needy Long Term Care, and Medically Needy Long Term Care with Spend Down.

PO08414, WorkItem:250120 - Lump sum amount income is not being counted by rules for the month that it was reported  

**Issue Description:**  
For Streamlined Medicaid, Income evidence of type ‘Lump sum Amount’ is intended to be counted by rules only in the month that it was reported. For the initial eligibility result, this is working as expected. However, when subsequent reassessments are made on the case in the following calendar months, the new determinations no longer count the lump sum income amount in the month in which it was reported.

    *   Income: Wage and Salaries: $500/monthly with a start date set to the first of the current month.
    *   Income: Lump Sum Amount: $20000/monthly with a start date set to the first of the current month.
5.  Apply changes.
6.  Review the determinations on the newly created Streamlined Medicaid product delivery.
    *   The person will be ineligible for the current month and eligible thereafter.
    *   Within the ineligible coverage period, navigate to the Income tab and then to the Income page within the page group navigation bar.
    *   Note that for the current ineligible month, the lump sum has been included under the MAGI Based Income and MAGI Income (Annual Amount) columns in the Income Details list.
    *   The lump sum is not counted in subsequent eligible months (as expected).
7.  Move the server date forward to a day in the next calendar month.
8.  Add Medical Bills evidence with a start date set to the current server date (arbitrary change that does not impact eligibility).
9.  Apply changes.
10.  Review the determinations on the Streamlined Medicaid product delivery (as above).
11.  Issue: The person is now eligible for the previous month. For the previous month, the lump sum is not included under the MAGI Based Income column in the Income Details list. The MAGI Income (Annual Amount) is marked as Not Applicable.

**Resolution:**  
For Streamlined Medicaid, the lump sum income is counted by rules only in the month that it was reported regardless of the reassessment date.  
  
**Technical:**  
The following rules changes have been made to address this issue:  

*   RuleSet: /EJBServer/components/HCR/CREOLE_Rule_Sets/HealthCareRuleSet.xml
*   Rule Class: IncomeCPRCalculator
*   Rule Attribute: lumpsumIncomeAmountTimeline, the sum of the lumpsum records where each lump sum amount is timelined from its start date to the end of that month.
*   Rule Attribute: amountExcludedForMedicaidTimeline: lumpsumIncomeAmountTimeline is no longer included in this calculation as the lumpsumIncomeAmountTimeline is now constrained to the month in which it should be counted.

  

PO09380, WorkItem:273117 - Advanced Evidence Sharing is not logging the underlying stack trace if an unexpected failure occurs during a reflection call to the Insurance Affordability apply changes logic  

**Issue Description:**  
Insurance Affordability cases use specific logic to apply changes to evidence. As a result, it is necessary to use a reflection API to initiate the apply changes functionality. When an unexpected exception occurs during the activity in the Advanced Evidence Sharing workflow that attempts to automatically activate shared evidence on an Insurance Affordability target case, the underlying stack trace is not being logged by the reflection API call which is required to call the Insurance Affordability-specific apply changes logic.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** No  
  
**Prerequisite(s):**  

1.  An unexpected exception during the auto-activation of evidence on an Insurance Affordability integrated case is required to reproduce this issue.

**Steps to Reproduce:**  

1.  Login as an Insurance Affordability caseworker.
2.  Register a new Person and submit a new Insurance Affordability application.
3.  Authorize the application.
4.  Navigate to the newly created Insurance Affordability integrated case.
5.  Issue: The evidence has been shared but is left in edit on the target case as the auto-activate failed with an unexpected exception and the underlying stack trace has not been logged.

**Resolution:**  
The logic in Advanced Evidence Sharing for handling unexpected exceptions during the reflection API call has been updated to correctly log the underlying stack trace that caused the activation of evidence to fail.  
  

  

### Product Documentation

WorkItem:274665 - Introduction of new evidence sharing key terminology documentation  

**Issue Description:**  
When using evidence sharing, it can be helpful to have a list of key terms related to the feature. There is currently no such list for easy reference for evidence sharing.  
  
**User Interface Impact:** N/A  
  
**Steps to Reproduce:** N/A  
  
**Resolution:**  
The _Sharing evidence by using the evidence broker_ section in the IBM Documentation _Evidence_ information has been updated to now include a new section that covers the key terminology used in evidence sharing.  
  
For more information, see [https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=broker-evidence-sharing-key-terminology](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/spm/8.0.1?topic=broker-evidence-sharing-key-terminology).  
  

  

### Third Party Updates

WorkItem:266694 - Update the configuration and usage of XML Parsers  

Previously, the common XML parsers used in the SPM application were not cached and instead were instantiated and configured separately each time they were used. These parsers include the following:  

*   SAXBuilder
*   SAXParser
*   Oracle DOMParser
*   javax.xml.validation.SchemaFactory
*   XMLReader
*   SAXReader

The XML parsers are now available, configured, and cached in a single class - XMLParserCache. The default configuration for these XML parsers now also disallows external Doctype declarations and External Entities in the XML that they are parsing.  
  

WorkItem:272371 - Remove the Struts 1 JAR file from the Social Program Management (SPM) product  

Struts is a helper framework used by the Social Program Management (SPM) application to organize the page flow of the application and for information exchange. It is used as a passive request router (dispatcher).  
  
The version of Struts 1 previously delivered in SPM, 1.2.9-sp3, is now removed. A number of classes found in the 'struts 1.2.9-sp3.jar' were incompatible with some internal SPM configurations and can no longer be included. The Struts 1.2.9-sp3 JAR file was replaced with the 'spm-core-struts.jar' which does not contain those classes.  
  
As a result of this update, the following changes were made in the Java Development Environment deliverable.  

*   CuramCDEJ\\lib\\ext\\jar\\third_party_version.properties - the reference to Struts 1 was removed.
*   CuramCDEJ\\lib\\ext\\jar\\struts.jar - this JAR file was removed.
*   CuramCDEJ\\lib\\curam\\jar\\spm-core-struts.jar - this JAR file was added.

Notes on Deprecation
--------------------

This section describes artifacts that are deprecated in this release and the functionality that supersedes them.

Enhancements or defect fixes might require the contract of a development artifact to be changed. In this context, the contract of an artifact is its API or signature, for example, name, parameters, return values, and its documented statement of functionality, for example, Javadoc.

In these cases, deprecation is used to reduce the impact of the change on custom applications. The original artifact is preserved and marked as 'deprecated' to indicate that it has been superseded by other functionality (often a new artifact). Infrastructure is provided to assist you in identifying custom dependencies on these deprecated artifacts. Deprecation can affect customizations in a number of different ways and has some implications for customer support. For more information about deprecation, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Cúram Server Developer's Guide. This chapter describes what deprecation is, how it can affect custom code, what it means for support and the build infrastructure that helps pinpoint custom artifact dependencies on deprecated artifacts.

You can find out whether your code is affected by any of the following deprecations (and precisely where) by running the deprecationreport build target. If that build produces deprecation warnings, then you are affected by one or more of the deprecated artifacts that are itemized. For more information about using the build target and analyzing its output, see the 'Deprecation' chapter in the Cúram Server Developer's Guide.

Known Issues
------------

[Curam Enterprise Framework](#curam_enterprise_framework_knownissues)  
[Curam Modules](#curam_modules_knownissues)  
[Solutions](#solutions_knownissues)  
  

### Curam Enterprise Framework

[Common Intake](#common_intake_knownissues)  
  

#### Common Intake

WorkItem:273964 - An iPad user is forced to logout when trying to add a participant on any intake  

On an iPad, a user is unable to navigate to a page that uses the CKEditor. One such instance where this issue manifests is in Child Welfare. When a user creates a Child Welfare intake on an iPad, they are not able to navigate to the Participants tab.  
  
  

  

### Curam Modules

[Provider Management](#provider_management_knownissues)  

WorkItem:274649 - System message visibility field code-table blank value does not default to blank on edit of the record.  

A new drop-down field called 'Visibility' has been added to the table 'SystemMessage' in 8.0.1. The value determines the user group that the message is visible to, for example, 'Logged-in users', 'Public users' or 'Public and logged-in users'. For existing records on the 'SystemMessage' table, the value of the new field 'Visibility' is set to 'null'. The 'Visibility' field 'null' value has the same meaning as the default value of 'Logged-in user'. When a 'System Message' record with a 'Visibility' field value of 'null' is edited, the 'Visibility' field drop-down incorrectly defaults to 'Logged-in user' instead of a blank value.  
  
To address this issue, an additional property 'USE_DEFAULT="false"' needs to be added to the 'Visibility' 'FIELD element of the page SystemMessage_modifySystemMessage.vim. This will be updated in a subsequent release.  
  

  

#### Provider Management

WorkItem:103350 - Incorrect underpayment amount created when multiple service invoice line items reassessed due to change in service rate  

When there are multiple service invoice line items created and paid for a provider using a fixed amount service rate and payment option of 'pay fixed amount', if the service rate that was used to determine the payment amount is retrospectively modified, to a higher rate, for example, underpayments are not being generated for all of the affected service invoice line items.  
  

WorkItem:274492 - A 'Null' button appears on the Preview Contract confirmation modal  

When a caseworker views the Preview Contract confirmation modal, the 'Yes' button is incorrectly labeled as 'Null'. To view the Preview Contract confirmation dialog, perform the following steps:  

1.  Log in as a Provider Management manager.
2.  Click My Providers under Provider in the shortcuts panel.
3.  Click the Provider Reference Number hyperlink to open an existing provider in a new tab.
4.  Click the Financial tab and select Contracts.
5.  Create and generate a Utilization Contract for the contract to go to an Issued state.
6.  Select the Preview row-level action for the Utilization Contract.
7.  Issue: The 'Yes' button is incorrectly labeled as 'Null'.

  
  

  

### Solutions

[Child Welfare](#child_welfare_knownissues)  
  

#### Child Welfare

WorkItem:277357 - Buttons not dynamically displayed based on Reporter Type selected in Capture Reporter dialog  

When capturing Reporter information on a Child Welfare intake, depending on the reporter type selected, the modal buttons displayed should change. For example, when an 'Anonymous' type is selected, only the 'Cancel' and 'Finish' buttons should display. Currently, all three buttons (Cancel, Next, and Finish) are displayed regardless of the Reporter type selected.
