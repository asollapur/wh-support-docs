For a transitional period from July 1 2022 onwards, before the release of the new support website, new security, support, and installation information for Merativeâ„¢ Social Program Management is published here.

For versions of Social Program Management that were released before 1 October 2022, you can continue to access security, support, and installation information from the usual IBM resources.

You can open a support case as usual at the Merative Support Community, see [Merative Support](https://www.merative.com/support/social-program-management-support-details). Previously published support information is still available through the community.
