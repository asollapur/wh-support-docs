In general, you can continue to access security, support, and installation information from the usual IBM resources for versions of Social Program Management that were released before October 1 2022.

You can open a support case as usual at the [Merative Support Community](https://ibmwatsonhealth.force.com/mysupport). Previously published support information is still available through the community.
