From July 1 2022, Watson Care Manager documentation is no longer updated in IBM Documentation.

For a transitional period, before the release of the new documentation website, any important updates or addendums will be added here in PDF format.

## September 2022 release

In this release, we added further views to the bring-your-own-tool reporting solution, and we introduced a new security role resource: Delete Notes.

We also clarified the documentation that relates to client deletion notifications. Under data privacy regulations, you are automatically subscribed to client status data notifications, which notify you about client deletions in Watson Care Manager.

For updated documentation, see the following PDF addendum:
