## Coming soon for reporting

Bring your own tool

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Reporting</span>

To allow you to report on provider users, we are updating the USERS_V2_VIEW with a new attribute called PROVIDERID.

## Coming soon for security administrators

### Linking users to their provider organizations

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

To allow security administrators to register a user who is linked to a provider organization and can access the care team workspace, we are introducing provider users. A provider user can be linked to one provider organization from the provider registry and can only access the care team workspace. Security administrators can create, view, and edit a provider user's details, as well as suspend and close a provider user.

## Coming soon for administrators

### Viewing users linked to their provider organizations

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

To allow administrators to view which users are linked to provider organizations, we are adding a new tab to the provider page, accessed from the provider registry. The new tab called Care Team Users lists all the care team provider users who are linked to the provider organization they are associated with. Administrators can also view a userâ€™s home page to see which provider organization they are linked to.

## Coming soon for care teams

### Displaying provider user details throughout the care team application

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

For a care team provider user, their profile page will display which provider organization they are associated with. The provider organization will also be displayed beside the provider user's name wherever the username is displayed, throughout the care team application.

### Introducing the care team events list

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

To allow care team users to manage their clients' events, we are introducing the events page, which you can access from a client's summary page navigation bar. This page will display a client's upcoming and past events that were added by the care team. Each event has an associated type and date. Optionally, each event can also include time, duration, and description. From the events page care team users can add, edit, or delete an event.

## Coming soon for integrations and APIs

### Updating the client registration API

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

We are updating the existing client registration GET API, which shares the newly registered client details with an external system, to include additional attributes such as address, phone, email, birth and death, marital status, gender, identification, and name.
