To help you to prepare for upcoming releases, we are excited to give you a preview of what is coming soon in Watson Care Manager.

<!-- ## Coming soon for reporting

### Bring your own tool

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Reporting</span>

In the upcoming release, Watson Care Manager reporting is continuing to expand the views available in the BYOT reporting solution. We are including a new view in the Clinical and Vital category, which groups attributes that relate to a client's waist circumference, such as the measurement number, unit, and status.  

We are deprecating two views, USERS_V1_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW. We will be removing these views in a future release, and we recommend that you start using their new versions, USERS_V2_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW. We are relabelling the ‘rolename’ attribute to ‘defaultworkspace’ for USERS_V2_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW, to align with the Watson Care Manager application. When you update existing reports or create new reports which contain attributes that relate to USERS_V1_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW, use the new version of these views.

For the full list of views that are available, see the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/). For details on updates to existing views in the upcoming release, see the Release Notes section on the Data Summary page of the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/guides/datasummary?id=release-notes). -->

## Coming soon for administrators
### Watson Care Manager

### subscribing to client registration notifications (WHPOCWCMS - 80808)

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow external systems that are integrated with Watson Care Manager to receive notifications when a new client is registered in Watson Care Manager, we are adding the ability for you to subscribe external systems to client registration notifications. Watson Care Manager sends a notification to the external system about the update (through webhooks) so that the external system can retrieve the latest version of the data through the client registration API.

<!-- ## Coming soon for care teams

### Messaging clients through external messaging

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

When your administrator enables the external messaging feature, a messaging option, like the existing messaging option with the Connect Individuals application, will be displayed to you in the side navigation menu, and a banner notification will be displayed when there are new unread messages from your client. The Message Notifications page will display a list of all unread messages received from clients who are assigned to you. You can view a client’s messages from their Summary page, by selecting Messages on their Summary page. You can send new messages to your clients, which will be delivered to the clients through the external messaging API. You can read or clear the messages as needed, and filtering will be available. -->

## Coming soon for integrations and APIs

### Watson Care Manager

### Updating the client registration API to share new client registration data with external systems (WHPOCWCMS-80808)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

We are updating the client registration API so that it can share the new client registration data with an external system. When a new client is registered in Watson Care Manager, the external system can call in to receive details about this client. to include the ProviderOfferingID attribute. This attribute enables the external system to associate the provider and service when the external system receives this information from Watson Care Manager.
