<!-- ## Coming soon for administrators

### Subscribing to client registration notifications

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

To allow external systems that are integrated with Merative Integrated Care to receive notifications when a new client is registered in Merative Integrated Care, we are adding the ability for you to subscribe external systems to client registration notifications. Merative Integrated Care sends a notification to the external system about the update (through webhooks) so that the external system can retrieve the latest version of the data through the client registration API. -->

<!-- ## Coming soon for care teams

### Messaging clients through external messaging

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

When your administrator enables the external messaging feature, a messaging option, like the existing messaging option with the Connect Individuals application, will be displayed to you in the side navigation menu, and a banner notification will be displayed when there are new unread messages from your client. The Message Notifications page will display a list of all unread messages received from clients who are assigned to you. You can view a clientâ€™s messages from their Summary page, by selecting Messages on their Summary page. You can send new messages to your clients, which will be delivered to the clients through the external messaging API. You can read or clear the messages as needed, and filtering will be available. -->

<!-- ## Coming soon for integrations and APIs

### Updating the client registration API to share new client registration data with external systems

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Merative Integrated Care</span>

We are updating the client registration API so that it can share the new client registration data with an external system. When a new client is registered in Merative Integrated Care, the external system can call in to receive details about this client. -->
