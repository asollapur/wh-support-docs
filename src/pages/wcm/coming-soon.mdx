## Coming soon for reporting

### Bring your own tool

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Reporting</span>

In the upcoming release, Watson Care Manager reporting is continuing to expand the views available in the BYOT reporting solution. We are including a new view in the Clinical and Vital category, which groups attributes that relate to a client's waist circumference, such as the measurement number, unit, and status.  

We are deprecating two views, USERS_V1_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW. We will be removing these views in a future release, and we recommend that you start using their new versions, USERS_V2_VIEW and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW. We are relabelling the ‘rolename’ attribute to ‘defaultworkspace’ for USERS_V2_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V2_VIEW, to align with the Watson Care Manager application. When you update existing reports or create new reports which contain attributes that relate to USERS_V1_View and TEAM_MEMBERS_V1_VIEW, use the new version of these views.

For the full list of views that are available, see the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/). For details on updates to existing views in the upcoming release, see the Release Notes section on the Data Summary page of the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/guides/datasummary?id=release-notes).

## Coming soon for administrators

### Enabling external messaging between Watson Care Manager and external systems

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To facilitate messaging between care team members and clients, we are introducing the external messaging feature. The external messaging feature uses the external messaging API to allow exchange of messages between Watson Care Manager and a client’s external system. Messaging will be added as a data type in source systems. A webhooks notification will be added to inform the subscribers when a new message becomes available in Watson Care Manager through the external messaging API. You can hide or show the external messaging feature in the care team application. You can either enable external messaging or messaging with the Connect Individuals application, but not both.

## Coming soon for care teams

### Messaging clients through external messaging

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

When your administrator enables the external messaging feature, a messaging option, like the existing messaging option with the Connect Individuals application, will be displayed to you in the side navigation menu, and a banner notification will be displayed when there are new unread messages from your client. The Message Notifications page will display a list of all unread messages received from clients who are assigned to you. You can view a client’s messages from their Summary page, by selecting Messages on their Summary page. You can send new messages to your clients, which will be delivered to the clients through the external messaging API. You can read or clear the messages as needed, and filtering will be available.

## Coming soon for integrations and APIs

### Adding ProviderOfferingID to the inquiries API

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

We are updating the inquiries API to include the ProviderOfferingID attribute. This attribute enables the external system to associate the provider and service when the external system receives this information from Watson Care Manager.

### Introducing the external messaging API to enable external messaging between Watson Care Manager and external systems

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

We are introducing the external messaging API to facilitate the exchange of messages between care team members and clients. Care team members can send messages associated with clients through Watson Care Manager, and the external messaging API makes the messages available to the client's external portal. Similarly, clients can send messages from their external portals, and the external messaging API makes the messages available for viewing in Watson Care Manager to clients’ care teams.
