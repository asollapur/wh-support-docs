## Coming soon for reporting

### Bring your own tool

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Reporting</span>

In this release, Watson Care Manager reporting has continued to expand the views available in the BYOT reporting solution. We are including a new view in the Client data category, which will allow you to group clients who actively receive care management from your organization. The new view allows you to group clients by month and year, so you can see your organization's active clients who are receiving care for that period. For the full list of views that are available, see the Watson Care Manager reporting data catalog [here](https://merative.github.io/wcm-reporting-datacatalog/#/). (WHPOCWCMS-80627)

<!--
## Coming soon for administrators

### Longer answers in assessments and questionnaires (WHPOCWCMS-79369)

   <span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow administrators to configure standardised assessments/questionnaires as they are specified, we are introducing the ability to enter answer options of up to 200 characters. When configuring a question with long answer options in an assessment or a questionnaire, it is preferable to use a radio button list instead of a drop-down list. This will improve the readability of the answer when it is displayed in the assessment or questionnaire in the care team application.

## Coming soon for care teams

### Creating referrals for clients who care team users do not have access to

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow restricted access care team users to create referrals for clients they do not have access to, we are removing restrictions from the care team application that prevent users from creating referrals for clients they do not have access to. (WHPOCWCMS-79471)
<!--
## Coming soon for security administrators

### Configuring Delete Goals RBAC resource (WHPOCWCMS-79458, WHPOCWCMS-79461, WHPOCWCMS-79462)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow a security administrator to control if a user can or cannot delete client goals, we are introducing a new RBAC resource called Delete Goals. A security administrator will be able to grant or deny access to this RBAC resource within a user’s security role. If a user does not have access to Delete Goals, the delete goal action will be hidden from them. When we introduce this new resource Delete Goals, it will be automatically set to Access in all existing security roles.

## Coming soon for supervisors

### Viewing referrals history and comments (WHPOCWCMS-79541, WHPOCWCMS-79540)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow supervisors to view all updates and comments to a referral, we are introducing a new assignment history section in referrals. You will be able to view the assignment history, such as who was assigned the referral or if the referral was unassigned, including all comments entered. This will be visible from a supervisor’s Unassigned and Assigned Referrals pages.

### Adding comments to referral assignment (WHPOCWCMS-79542)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

To allow supervisors to record a comment when assigning a referral, we are introducing a new comment field.

## Coming soon for integrations and APIs

### Add to Plan row action on External Inquiries can only be selected once (WHPOCWCMS-79855)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

The Add to Plan row action on the External Inquiries list page, could be selected multiple times. Each time this action was selected, the External Inquiry API was triggered. To prevent this, the Add to Plan row action will be disabled once it has been selected by the user. This will ensure that the API is triggered just once.

### Including Add to Plan in the External Inquiries API (WHPOCWCMS-79491)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

Including Add to Plan in the External Inquiries API will effectively close the loop on the referral. The provider is informed that the service has been added to the client’s plan.

### Adding Service Delivery ID to Notes API (WHPOCWCMS-79509)

<span style="background-color: lightblue;">Watson Care Manager</span>

The existing Notes API will be updated to include the Service Delivery ID. This enables external providers to provide feedback via API, on a service offered or provided to a client.
